\section{Method}

The motion planning problem is the problem of finding a path for a robot from an initial configuration to a goal configuration while avoiding obstacles. 
With uncertainties present, the problem is challenging as a collision free regular path no longer can guarantee that obstacles are avoided. 
However, by assuming that the uncertainties are bounded, guarantees can be made in the path planning.
In this paper, we develop the \rrtfunnel algorithm to solve motion planning problem in the presence of bounded uncertainties.

In the work presented in \cite{majumdarFunnelLibrariesRealtime2017}, a framework for motion planning with uncertainties is presented. 
The framework is capable of finding robust funnels: regions that the vehicle are guaranteed to stay within, as long as the uncertainties are bounded.
The robust funnels themselves are computationally heavy to compute, and are therefore found offline. 
A full collection of funnels is created, corresponding to different feasible maneuvers. 
At run-time, the funnels are evaluated against the obstacle map, and an collision free funnel is selected for path following. 
The selection of a single funnel to follow at a time limits the planning horizon to the funnel length. 
In our work, we seek to combine funnels sequentially in the planning process in order to extend the planning horizon of the motion planning algorithm.


We use the RRT algorithm as basis for our new method, as it is widely used and is the basis for many recent motion planning algorithms. 
However, the concepts presented in our work could be implemented with any sampling-based algorithm that can use samples consisting of motion primitives.
The main steps of our method is as follows:
First, we create a collection of funnels that we can use as simple and robust motion primitives.
Then, we ensure that the funnels can be sequentially composed without losing robustness guarantees.
Lastly, we use the funnels as motion primitives in the RRT algorithm, thereby obtaining a robust path planning algorithm.


% This paper develops the \rrtfunnel{} algorithm, by two means: First it employs
% robust motion primitives generated by the the SOS programming framework based on
% the work in \cite{majumdarFunnelLibrariesRealtime2017}, and second, deploy these
% funnels as robust motion primitives in a discrete RRT robust motion planner
% based on \cite{Lav06}. Using robust motion primitives has several advantages.
% Firstly, they handle uncertainty, and thus, as long as the uncertainties in the
% system are akin to the assumptions on the incoming uncertainty parameters, the
% dynamical system will not leave the funnel, and hence if the funnel is not in
% collision, neither will the system be. Secondly, as the motion primitives are
% robust, there is no need for more conservative maneuvers and heuristics, such as
% maximizing the distance to an obstacle, which is a naive way for motion planners
% to handle uncertainty. Since the primitives are robust, the system might as well
% choose a primitive that is close to an obstacle, as one that is far away, since
% the funnel is guaranteed to be collision-free in both cases. 

\todo[inline]{Flytt dette til intro:}
This means that a robust motion algorithm can perform more aggressive maneuvers than one that is
inherently conservative about its environment and
maneuvers~\cite{singhRobustOnlineMotion2017}.


% \subsection{Problem Statement}
\subsection{Funnels}
\label{sec:funnels}

Given the nonlinear dynamical system
\begin{equation}
  \dot{\vect{x}} = f\big(\vect{x}(t), \vect{u}(t), w(t)
  \big), \label{eq:dynamicalsystem}
\end{equation}
with state \(\vect{x}(t) \in \R^3\), \(\vect{u}(t) \in \R\), and \(w(t) \in
\R\). Get the dynamical system safely from an initial pose \(I_{0}\), to a final
pose \(I_{f}\) through a known environment with bounded uncertainty in the
postition of the system, given a set of robustly verified discrete motion primitives through
the use of SOS programming to verify the reachable set for each of the
trajectories in a base set of trajectories \(T_{0}\).


The uncertainty guarantees in this paper is given through the creation of
\textit{funnels}. Funnels are the parameterizations of the \textit{finite time
  reachable sets} for the dynamic system in \refeq{eq:dynamicalsystem}.

This means that a Funnel holds all the states the dynamical system can be in
during a planning task. Mathematically the reachable set of the system is
defined as
\[
  \vect{x}(0) \in \mathcal{X}_0 \implies \vect{x}(t) \in F(t), \forall t \in
  \sqb{0,T},
\]
where \(\mathcal{X}_0\) is the set of initial conditions, \(\sqb{0,T}\) the time
interval, and \(F(t)\) is the set of states that the system can be in at time
\(t\) \cite{majumdarFunnelLibrariesRealtime2017}. Although this paper concerns
itself with approximating the reachable set through \textit{Lyapunov} functions,
a useful analogy is imagining the funnel created through a \textit{Monte-Carlo}
simulation, where the funnel is the set of all the paths traversed by the
dynamic system.

\subsubsection{Generating the Trajectories}
\label{subsec:generating-the-trajectories}

In order to verify the robust regions surrounding a trajectory, first the
trajectories themselves have to be created. Generating optimal trajectories is a
rich field in the motion planning literature~\cite{Betts_1998}. The initial
trajectories can be generated by many different methods, however
the \textit{direct collocation method}~\cite{von1993numerical} suited the needs
of this paper best. It was chosen as it builds locally optimal trajectories from
a discrete set of sampled points along a sought trajectory, which is beneficial
for the discrete funnel verification employed. For this problem the cost
function chosen for the solver to minimize is:
\begin{equation}
  J = \int_{0}^{T} \left[ 1 + {\vect{u}_{0}}^{T} \matr{R} \vect{u}_{0} \right] \mathrm{d}t,
\end{equation}
where \(\matr{R} = 1\), because it will minimize the system input, and thus give
a smooth output trajectory~\cite{majumdarRobustOnlineMotion2013}.


%\subsubsection{Initializing the Funnel Calculations}
\label{subsec:initializing-tvlqr}

The funnel calculation algorithm has to be initialized with a candidate Lyapunov
function. In the same way as in Majumdar~\cite{majumdarRobustOnlineMotion2013},
the funnel generation algorithm will be initialized with a Time Varying Linear Quadratic Regulator (TV-LQR) as
the initial Lyapunov function employing a cost function of the form
\begin{IEEEeqnarray*}{ll}
  J &= \vect{x}^{T} (t_f) \matr{F}(t_f) \vect{x} (t_f) \IEEEyesnumber \\
    &+ \int_{t_{0}}^{t_{f}} \left( \vect{x}^{T} \matr{Q} \vect{x} + \vect{u}^{T} \matr{R} \vect{u} + 2 \vect{x}^T \matr{N} \vect{u} \right) \mathrm{d}t,
\end{IEEEeqnarray*}

\subsubsection{Generating Funnels around the Initial Trajectories}
\label{sec:generating-funnels-initial}

With the set of initial trajectories generated from the \textit{direct
  collocation method} in \ref{subsec:generating-the-trajectories}, using SoS
optimization it is possible to generate an area around the trajectories which
are able to handle a bounded uncertainty parameters. This is done through the
SoS optimization framework from Majumdar
\cite{majumdarFunnelLibrariesRealtime2017}. This method takes as input the
initial trajectories, and an initial trajectory, and outputs a verified region
around the trajectories which are guaranteed to be collision free as long as the
input uncertainties are bounded.


\subsubsection{Sequential Funnel Composition}
\label{sec:composable-funnels}


Once funnels have been generated as discrete motion primitives, it is time to
handle the overarching goal of creating a plan consisting of multiple funnels
chained from start to finish, so that safe traversal can be guaranteed along the
given planning trajectory. In order for two funnels to create one extended
motion primitive from multiple smaller primitives, the funnels in use must be
composable. In order for two funnels to be composable, the outlet of one funnel
needs to be completely contained within the inlet of the other. An abstract
pictorial representation of two funnels composed together can be seen
in~\cref{fig:two-funnels-composed} to emphasize this observation.

% This means that
% if \(\mathcal{F}_1 = F_1(T)\) is the outlet of funnel \(F_1\), and
% \(\mathcal{F}_2 = F_2(0)\) is the inlet of \(F_2\), then
% \begin{equation}
%   \label{eq:funnel-subset}
%   \mathcal{F}_1 \subseteq \mathcal{F}_2
% \end{equation}
% is required in order for the funnels to be composable.
% \begin{definition}
%   \label{def:funnel-composition}
%   An ordered pair \((F_{1}, F_{2})\) of funnels \(F_1 \colon [0,T_1] \rightarrow
%   \mathcal{P}(\R^n)\) and \(F_2 \colon [0,T_2] \rightarrow \mathcal{P}(\R^n)\)
%   are sequentially composable if \(F_1(T) \subseteq F_2(0)\).
% \end{definition}
% Because the implication
% \begin{equation}
%   V_1(T_1,\bar{\vect{x}}) \leq \rho_1(T_1) \implies V_2(0,\bar{\vect{x}}) \leq
%   \rho_2(0)
% \end{equation}
% \kma{Hvor har vi $V_1$, $V_2$, $\rho_1$ og $\rho_2$ fra? De burde forklares i teksten}
% is an equivalent condition to \cref{eq:funnel-subset}, and because it can be
% checked through the following SOS program
% \begin{IEEEeqnarray*}{lC}
%   \text{Find } \; L(\bar{x}) \IEEEyesnumber \\
%   \text{s.t.} \\
%   \IEEEeqnarraymulticol{2}{l}{\rho_2(0) - V_2( 0,\bar{\vect{x}}) - L(\bar{\vect{x}})
%                   \bigl( \rho_1(T_1) - V_1(T_1,\bar{\vect{x}}) \bigr) \quad \text{is SOS}} \mathEoS \nonumber
% \end{IEEEeqnarray*}
% \cite{majumdarRobustOnlineMotion2013}

Since the funnels can be shifted freely around the configuration space along the
cyclic coordinates of the system to create new motion primitives, the funnels
can be composed together by the RRT algorithm in the planning environment and
create a guaranteed robust motion plan through chaining multiple verified
funnels together into a longer and verified motion primitive.

    first one is fully contained in the inlet of the second.

  \label{fig:two-funnels-composed}
\end{figure}

\subsection{RRT}
\label{sec:RRT}

With the basic framework for dealing with funnels as motion primitives
constructed, it is time to build the RRT part of the \rrtfunnel{} algorithm. The
reason for basing the global path planning framework on the RRT motion planning
algorithm is twofold. Firstly, it has the ability to quickly expand deep into the
search-space, and then later progress towards a finer sampling, which is
valuable as it avoids local minima. Secondly, the RRT algorithm is easily extensible
to larger state spaces, and the  \rrtfunnel{}
algorithm can therefore be adapted to fit a wide range of dynamical systems.
Extending the RRT algorithm to a larger state space only require modifying the three main components;  the probability distribution to sample from, the distance metric for the nearest neighbor and the extension step. The RRT
algorithm is beneficial as most of the complexity accompanied with the planning
problem (like uncertainty and controller calculations) has already been handled
by the SOS framework, and hence the RRT algorithm need only concern itself with
stacking one robust motion primitive after the other without any concern for the
complexities associated with uncertain dynamical systems.

\subsubsection{Distance in Configuration Space}

The \rrtfunnel{} algorithm will use the same metric for both the closest node
and the extend operation on the funnel graph. The metric chosen is a modified
Euclidean metric which weights the angle \(\theta\) depending on how close the
dynamical system is to the final configuration, and is defined as
\[
  \rho(\vect{x}_{1}, \vect{x}_{2}) = w_{1}\norm{\mathnormal{X_{1}} -
    \mathnormal{X_{2}}} + w_{2}f(\theta_1,\theta_2) ,
\]
where \(\norm{\mathnormal{X_{1}} - \mathnormal{X_{2}}}\) is the standard
Euclidean metric, \(f\) is a positive scalar function giving the angle between
headings~\cite{kuffnerEffectiveSamplingDistance2004}. The rotations and distance
is then scaled relative to the translation distance by \(w_{1}\) and \(w_{2}\).
Which helps solve some of the problems with the Euclidean distance metric
\cite{Lav06}.

\subsubsection{The Funnel-Graph}

It is helpful to associate some structure along with the funnels which the
\rrtfunnel{} algorithm employs at the planning stage. This is because not all
funnels are compatible, as one funnels outlet might not fit into the outlet of
another. Thus the funnels generated can be imagined as a directed graph, where
an edge from funnel A to funnel B means that \((A,B)\) are composable. Thus a
brute-force search for compatible funnels at planning time is eliminated. Hence
the funnels are organized into a graph structure \(\mathcal{G}\) where each
funnel is an edge in the graph.

%     \caption{The verified trajectory ellipsis overlaid at the sample times.}
%     \label{fig:funnel-straight-sampled}
%   \end{minipage}
% \end{figure}


\subsubsection{Expanding the Size of the Funnels}

In general the funnels generated are computed only for the point model in
\cref{eq:dynamicalsystem}, and hence, in order to run the algorithm with a
model of some defined size, the funnels have to be expanded by the largest
radius of the model. Since the funnels are ellipsis around the point at the
trajectory that they verify, the funnels can be expanded by any radius with a
linear transformation. An expansion of a funnel around the point model used in
this paper can be seen in \cref{fig:expanded-funnel}.
