\section{Method}

This paper develops the \rrtfunnel{} algorithm, by two means: First it employs
robust motion primitives generated by the the SOS programming framework based on
the work in \cite{majumdarFunnelLibrariesRealtime2017}, and second, deploy these
funnels as robust motion primitives in a discrete RRT robust motion planner
based on \cite{Lav06}. Using robust motion primitives has several advantages.
Firstly, they handle uncertainty, and thus, as long as the uncertainties in the
system are akin to the assumptions on the incoming uncertainty parameters, the
dynamical system will not leave the funnel, and hence if the funnel is not in
collision, neither will the system be. Secondly, as the motion primitives are
robust, there is no need for more conservative maneuvers and heuristics, such as
maximizing the distance to an obstacle, which is a naive way for motion planners
to handle uncertainty. Since the primitives are robust, the system might as well
choose a primitive that is close to an obstacle, as one that is far away, since
the funnel is guaranteed to be collision-free in both cases. This means that a
robust motion algorithm can perform more aggressive maneuvers than one that is
inherently conservative about its environment and
maneuvers~\cite{singhRobustOnlineMotion2017}.


\subsection{Problem Statement}

Given the nonlinear dynamical system
\begin{equation}
  \dot{\vect{x}} = f\big(\vect{x}(t), \vect{u}(t), w(t)
  \big), \label{eq:dynamicalsystem}
\end{equation}
with state \(\vect{x}(t) \in \R^3\), \(\vect{u}(t) \in \R\), and \(w(t) \in
\R\). Then create a set of robustly verified discrete motion primitives through
the use of SOS programming to verify the reachable set for each of the
trajectories in a base set of trajectories \(T_{0}\). Next, apply these
trajectories, with the robust reachable set surrounding them as motion
primitives for a discrete RRT motion planning algorithm and compare the results
to a RRT algorithm which does not employ the reachable sets around the base
trajectories, but instead relies on maximizing the distance to the nearest
obstacles, in order to handle uncertainty.



\subsection{Funnels}
\label{sec:funnels}

The uncertainty guarantees in this paper is given through the creation of
\textit{funnels}. Funnels are the parameterizations of the \textit{finite time
  reachable sets} for the dynamic system in \refeq{eq:dynamicalsystem}.

This means that a Funnel holds all the states the dynamical system can be in
during a planning task. Mathematically the reachable set of the system is
defined as
\[
  \vect{x}(0) \in \mathcal{X}_0 \implies \vect{x}(t) \in F(t), \forall t \in
  \sqb{0,T},
\]
where \(\mathcal{X}_0\) is the set of initial conditions, \(\sqb{0,T}\) the time
interval, and \(F(t)\) is the set of states that the system can be in at time
\(t\) \cite{majumdarFunnelLibrariesRealtime2017}. Although this paper concerns
itself with approximating the reachable set through \textit{Lyapunov} functions,
a useful analogy is imagining the funnel created through a \textit{Monte-Carlo}
simulation, where the funnel is the set of all the paths traversed by the
dynamic system.

\subsubsection{Generating Trajectories}
\label{subsec:generating-trajectories}

In order to verify the robust regions surrounding a trajectory, first the
trajectories themselves have to be created. Generating optimal trajectories is a
rich field in the motion planning literature~\cite{Betts_1998}. The initial
trajectories can be generated by many different methods, however
the \textit{direct collocation method}~\cite{von1993numerical} suited the needs
of this paper best. It was chosen as it builds locally optimal trajectories from
a discrete set of sampled points along a sought trajectory, which is beneficial
for the discrete funnel verification employed. For this problem the cost
function chosen for the solver to minimize is:
\begin{equation}
  J = \int_{0}^{T} \left[ 1 + {\vect{u}_{0}}^{T} \matr{R} \vect{u}_{0} \right] \mathrm{d}t,
\end{equation}
where \(\matr{R} = 1\), because it will minimize the system input, and thus give
a smooth output trajectory~\cite{majumdarRobustOnlineMotion2013}.


\subsubsection{Initializing the Funnel Calculations}
\label{subsec:initializing-tvlqr}

The funnel calculation algorithm has to be initialized with a candidate Lyapunov
function. In the same way as in Majumdar~\cite{majumdarRobustOnlineMotion2013},
the funnel generation algorithm will be initialized with a Time Varying Linear Quadratic Regulator (TV-LQR) as
the initial Lyapunov function employing a cost function of the form
\begin{IEEEeqnarray*}{ll}
  J &= \vect{x}^{T} (t_f) \matr{F}(t_f) \vect{x} (t_f) \IEEEyesnumber \\
    &+ \int_{t_{0}}^{t_{f}} \left( \vect{x}^{T} \matr{Q} \vect{x} + \vect{u}^{T} \matr{R} \vect{u} + 2 \vect{x}^T \matr{N} \vect{u} \right) \mathrm{d}t,
\end{IEEEeqnarray*}

\subsubsection{Generating Funnels around the Initial Trajectories}
\label{sec:generating-funnels-initial}

With the set of initial trajectories generated from the \textit{direct
  collocation method} in \ref{subsec:generating-trajectories}, using SoS
optimization it is possible to generate an area around the trajectories which
are able to handle a bounded uncertainty parameters. This is done through the SOS optimization framework from Majumdar~\cite{majumdarFunnelLibrariesRealtime2017}. This method takes as input the initial trajectories, and an initial
Lyapunov function, and outputs a verified region around the trajectories which
are guaranteed to be collision free as long as the system uncertainties are
bounded.


\subsubsection{Sequential Funnel Composition}
\label{sec:composable-funnels}


Once funnels have been generated as discrete motion primitives, it is time to
handle the overarching goal of creating a plan consisting of multiple funnels
chained from start to finish, so that safe traversal can be guaranteed along the
given planning trajectory. In order for two funnels to create one extended
motion primitive from multiple smaller primitives, the funnels in use must be
composable. In order for two funnels to be composable, the outlet of one funnel
needs to be completely contained within the inlet of the other~\cite{majumdarRobustOnlineMotion2013}. An abstract
pictorial representation of two funnels composed together can be seen
in~\cref{fig:two-funnels-composed} to emphasize this observation.

Since the funnels can be shifted freely around the configuration space along the
cyclic coordinates of the system to create new motion
primitives~\cite{majumdarRobustOnlineMotion2013}, the funnels can be composed
together by the RRT algorithm in the planning environment and create a
guaranteed robust motion plan through chaining multiple verified funnels
together into a longer and verified motion primitive.

    first one is fully contained in the inlet of the second.

\end{figure}

\subsection{RRT}
\label{sec:RRT}

With the basic framework for dealing with funnels as motion primitives
constructed, it is time to build the RRT part of the \rrtfunnel{} algorithm. The
reason for basing the global path planning framework on the RRT motion planning
algorithm is twofold. Firstly, it has the ability to quickly expand deep into the
search-space, and then later progress towards a finer sampling, which is
valuable as it avoids local minima. Secondly, the RRT algorithm is extensible
to larger state spaces, and the  \rrtfunnel{}
algorithm can therefore be adapted to fit a wide range of dynamical systems.
Extending the RRT algorithm to a larger state space requires modifying the three main components;  the probability distribution to sample from, the distance metric for the nearest neighbor and the extension step. The RRT
algorithm is beneficial as most of the complexity accompanied with the planning
problem (like uncertainty and controller calculations) is handled
by the SOS framework, and hence the RRT algorithm need only concern itself with
stacking one robust motion primitive after the other without any concern for the
complexities associated with uncertain dynamical systems.

\subsubsection{Distance in Configuration Space}

The \rrtfunnel{} algorithm will use the same metric for both the closest node
and the extend operation on the funnel graph. The metric chosen is a modified
Euclidean metric which weights the angle \(\theta\) depending on how close the
dynamical system is to the final configuration, and is defined as
\[
  \rho(\vect{x}_{1}, \vect{x}_{2}) = w_{1}\norm{\mathnormal{X_{1}} -
    \mathnormal{X_{2}}} + w_{2}f(\theta_1,\theta_2) ,
\]
where \(\norm{\mathnormal{X_{1}} - \mathnormal{X_{2}}}\) is the standard
Euclidean metric, \(f\) is a positive scalar function giving the angle between
headings~\cite{kuffnerEffectiveSamplingDistance2004}. The rotations and distance
is then scaled relative to the translation distance by \(w_{1}\) and \(w_{2}\).
Which helps solve some of the problems with the Euclidean distance metric
\cite{Lav06}.

\subsubsection{Optimize the Selection Step}

It is helpful to associate some structure along with the funnels which the RRT-Funnel algorithm
employs at the planning stage~\cite{majumdarRobustOnlineMotion2013}. This is because not all funnels
are compatible, as one funnels outlet might not fit into the
outlet of another. Thus the funnels generated can be imagined
as a directed graph, where an edge from funnel A to funnel B
means that \(\left( A,B \right)\) are composable. Thus a brute-force search
for compatible funnels at planning time is eliminated. Hence
the funnels are organized into a graph structure \(\mathcal{G}\) where each
funnel is an edge in the graph. Therefore no test to see if two funnels in the
motion primitive set are compatible is needed.

\subsubsection{Expanding the Size of the Funnels}

In general the funnels generated are computed only for the point model in
\cref{eq:dynamicalsystem}, and hence, in order to run the algorithm with a
model of some defined size, the funnels have to be expanded by the largest
radius of the model. Since the funnels are ellipsis around the point at the
trajectory that they verify, the funnels can be expanded by any radius with a
linear transformation. An expansion of a funnel around the point model used in
this paper can be seen in \cref{fig:expanded-funnel}.
